# arduino-quadcopter
This repository provides arduino scripts to run a quadcopter.
For my quadcopter I used a Multiwii board which has a ATMega328p microcontroller and a MPU6050 sensor.

2do: 
- translate code comments
- test a low-pass filter on gyro signal before it is used for angle calculation
- use barometric sensor for altitute control
- use magnetometer for yaw control
